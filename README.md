#### Change branches in git
Switch Branch using git checkout
The easiest way to switch branch on Git is to use the “git checkout” command and specify the name of the branch you want to switch to.

If the destination branch does not exist, you have to append the “-b” option, otherwise you won’t be able to switch to that branch.

$ git checkout <existing_branch>

$ git checkout -b <new_branch>
